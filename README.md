# Web Storage Testing
**CPAN134 Assignment 2**

# Reflection
I learned something useful, and it's that a combination of HTML and CSS can actually be used to store persistent data in the browser, and without the use of cookies. Just pure web storage in the form of retrieving, setting and clearing values. I also learned a bit about DOM manipulation which is used to edit page contents with JS. It's a bit tricky to get right because there are many different things that must be kept in mind when manipulating the DOM; if you think whatever code you wrote in JS is the correct way to manipulate DOM, it probably isn't. Not until the next few times that you try to make it work.
